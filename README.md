# Braille Orchard

## Description

This is a simple game in which you plant an orchard. Trees are represented by braille shapes, which show plants coming up from seeds, through to saplings, through to stalks (or weeds). If the plant gets as far as being a full stalk, fruit starts to grow in the right-hand side of the cell.

## Pruning

You can use the keyboard to move around your farm, and harvest the trees you have planted.

- Move around the field: w, a, s, and d keys.
- Chop down a plant: c.
- Harvest a plant: h.
- Plant a new seed: p.
- Visit the market: m.

## Handbook

You start off with an empty field. If nothing is planted, then weeds will begin to sprout. You need to remove all weeds by chopping them once you have moved to them. They are represented by the character ⠞.

To plant a new seed, move to an empty part of the field, then plant a seed. You will see a seed has been planted by the character ⠄.

When a seed has grown a bit, it will be a sapling. At this point, it will be represented by the character ⠆. At this point, there is a 50/50 chance of it turning into a weed, or growing into a full stalk, which will be represented by the character ⠇.

When a plant gets its first fruit, it will be represented by a character ⠗. At this point it can be harvested.

If left alone, another fruit will grow, and the plant will be represented by the character ⠟.

## Harvesting

When you harvest fruits, they get added to your basked. You can sell the fruits in your basket as well as buy new seeds in the market. The prices in the market will fluctuate, but that's just commerce, I'm afraid.
